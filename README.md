# Intelligent-Coding-Assistant-Project
Intelligent Coding Assistant Project: Discover a user-friendly, step-by-step framework that harnesses the power of GPT-4 to facilitate collaborative code-writing in python. Boost your coding efficiency with tailored AI-generated prompts and guidance.

# Getting Started

To get started with the Intelligent Coding Assistant Project, follow these steps:

**Read the Documentation**: Begin by reading the **'Documentation.md'** file. This file provides a comprehensive overview of the project, its objectives, and the methodology used in developing the clever prompting architectures.

**Review the Guide**: Next, explore the **'Guide.md'** file, which contains the final coding guide and prompts. This guide will walk you through the process of using the Intelligent Coding Assistant with GPT-4 to generate code effectively.

**Examine the Project Folders**: The repository contains five folders: one for the simple Transformer model and four for the Edabit coding challenges. Each of these folders includes a conversation with ChatGPT in the form of a **'ChatGPT-Conversation.md'** document. Additionally, each folder contains the generated code.

+ **Transformer Folder**: This folder contains all the files required to run the code, such as dataset **'.txt'** files, and copy of the original kaggle notebook that I used.

+ **Edabit Challenge Folders**: These four folders contain the solutions for the respective coding challenges. Each folder also includes an additional screenshot demonstrating that the code has passed the Edabit tests.

By exploring the contents of this repository, you'll gain valuable insights into how the Intelligent Coding Assistant Project leverages GPT-4 to generate code.
